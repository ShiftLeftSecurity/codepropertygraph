/* ForkJoinParallelCpgPass is a possible replacement for CpgPass and ParallelCpgPass.
 *
 * Instead of returning an Iterator, generateParts() returns an Array. This means that the entire collection
 * of parts must live on the heap at the same time; on the other hand, there are no possible issues with iterator invalidation,
 * e.g. when running over all METHOD nodes and deleting some of them.
 *
 * Instead of streaming writes as ParallelCpgPass or ConcurrentWriterCpgPass do, all `runOnPart` invocations read the initial state
 * of the graph. Then all changes (accumulated in the DiffGraphBuilders) are merged into a single change, and applied in one go.
 *
 * In other words, the parallelism follows the fork/join parallel map-reduce (java: collect, scala: aggregate) model.
 * The effect is identical as if one were to sequentially run `runOnParts` on all output elements of `generateParts()`
 * in sequential order, with the same builder.
 *
 * This simplifies semantics and makes it easy to reason about possible races.
 *
 * Note that ForkJoinParallelCpgPass never writes intermediate results, so one must consider peak memory consumption when
 * porting from ParallelCpgPass. Consider ConcurrentWriterCpgPass when this is a problem.
 *
 * Initialization and cleanup of external resources or large datastructures can be done in the `init()` and `finish()`
 * methods. This may be better than using the constructor or GC, because e.g. SCPG chains of passes construct
 * passes eagerly, and releases them only when the entire chain has run.
