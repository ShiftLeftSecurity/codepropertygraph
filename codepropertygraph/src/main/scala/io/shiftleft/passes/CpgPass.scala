/**
  * Base class for CPG pass - a program, which receives an input graph
  * and outputs a sequence of additive diff graphs. These diff graphs can
  * be merged into the original graph ("applied"), they can be serialized
  * into a binary format, and finally, they can be added to an existing
  * cpg.bin.zip file.
  *
  * A pass is provided by inheriting from this class and implementing `run`,
  * a method, which creates the sequence of diff graphs from an input graph.
  *
  * Overview of steps and their meaning:
  *
  * 1. Create: A sequence of diff graphs is created from the source graph
  * 2. Apply: Each diff graph can be applied to the source graph
  * 3. Serialize: After applying a diff graph, the diff graph can be serialized into a CPG overlay
  * 4. Store: The CPG overlay can be stored in a serialized CPG.
  *
  * @param cpg the source CPG this pass traverses
