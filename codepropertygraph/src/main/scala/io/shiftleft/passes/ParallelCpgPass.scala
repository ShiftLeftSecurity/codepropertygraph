/* ConcurrentWriterCpgPass is a possible replacement for ParallelCpgPass and NewStylePass.
 *
 * Instead of returning an Iterator, generateParts() returns an Array. This means that the entire collection
 * of parts must live on the heap at the same time; on the other hand, there are no possible issues with iterator invalidation,
 * e.g. when running over all METHOD nodes and deleting some of them.
 *
 * Changes are applied sequentially, in the same order as the output of `runOnParts`, as opposed to `ParallelCpgPass`,
 * where the ordering of change application is non-deterministic. For this reason, ConcurrentWriterCpgPass only accepts a single KeyPool.
 *
 * However, as opposed to NewStylePass, changes are not buffered and applied in one go; instead, they are applied as the respective
 * `runOnPart` finishes, concurrently with other `runOnPart` invocations.
 *
 * Compared to NewStylePass, this avoids excessive peak memory consumption. On the other hand, `runOnPart` sees the CPG
 * in an intermediate state: No promises are made about which previous changes are already applied; and changes are
 * applied concurrently, such that all reads from the graph are potential race conditions. Furthermore, this variant has
 * higher constant overhead per part than NewStylePass, i.e. is better suited to passes that create few large diffs.
 *
 *
 * Initialization and cleanup of external resources or large datastructures can be done in the `init()` and `finish()`
 * methods. This may be better than using the constructor or GC, because e.g. SCPG chains of passes construct
 * passes eagerly, and releases them only when the entire chain has run.
